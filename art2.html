        <p>Drawing inspiration taken from the popular indie video game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/206440/To_the_Moon/">"To The Moon"</a>. I have been practicing some drawings and art work from different games. This is beacuse I want to be able to help my friend with the graphics and art components of his game which he is trying to develop. I can use those experiences for other future products with different people.</p>
