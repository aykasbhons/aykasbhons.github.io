        <p>Drawing inspiration taken from the popular Japanese animated movie <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5311514/">"Your Name"</a>. I had always been fond of watching Japanese animated shows and movies. The art style really stuck with me, so I decided to try to practice this form and maybe pick up some animation on the way for any future use with the skills. Just the drawing is enough as I would be able to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manga">"manga"</a>, which is a Japanese animated graphic novel.</p>
